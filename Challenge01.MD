# Challenge 01: FizzBuzz

## Overview
One you may have heard of before but we are starting with a common interview test for junior engineers. 

FizzBuzz!

For this challenge, you need to write a function that:
- Takes a number n as input
- Returns an array containing values from 1 to n, where:
  - If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with "Fizz"
  - If the number is divisible by 5, replace it with "Buzz"
  - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, replace it with "FizzBuzz"
  - Otherwise, keep the number as is

### Example Output
```javascript
fizzBuzz(15) // returns:
[
  1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz",
  11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz"
]
```

## Rules
To help you with best practices for all future challenges, you will use the following Git workflow.

1. Fork this repo to your own Git
2. Create your working branch using this naming convention:
   - `feat/` - for the main work
   - `fix/` - for things you need to improve
   - `chore/` - for things you need to clean up

Example:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/CC-challenge-1-fizz-buzz
```

## Requirements
- Write tests for your solution
- Think about edge cases
- When complete, merge everything into main
- Post your solution link in the challenge thread

## Dependencies
- - This is written in Javascript so you will need to think about NPM and the packages you will need to add, like Jest for testing
- I suggest you use Jest for testing
- Use the .gitignore
